#Ironhub

Ironhub is a spin off the project that AVGP created [cloud9hub](https://github.com/AVGP/cloud9hub).
Rebuilt using [flatiron] (https://github.com/flatiron/flatiron) framework, this project aims to provide a  modular/pluggable multi-project development environment
using the [cloud9ide](https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9) for local "in house" projects.

##Features
* passport integration for multiple authentication methods (pluggable)
* User and team management framework (for access to projects)
* framwwork / boiler plate project creation selection (eg. express, flatiron, etc.)
* project deletion locks, freezes, time tracking (per user) for aggregated current project duration

##Future features
* project tracking
* user communication framework (chat, discussions, history)
* file notations / explanations
* application whitepaper creation from notations / explanations with table of contents of application use and api
* project template creation (similar to boiler plate), from existing projects, for agile project development and workspace creation
